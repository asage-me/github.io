I figured a good first post would probably be how I set up this site.  It was quite a learning experience and took me way longer that I thought due to all the rabbit holes I ventured down that I probably should have avoided.

The resources for this guide are all in pages on this site.  [Here](/pages) is a sitemap for all my pages.

1. The first step is to get a new domain if you plan on using a custom domain
   - [Set up DNS](/pages/github/pages/set-up-dns)
2. [Install WSL](/pages/wsl/install)
3. [Install Docker Desktop](/pages/docker-desktop/install)
      > Make sure you installed WSL so Docker Desktop can use it
      {: .prompt-tip }
4. [Install git](/pages/git/install) 
5. [Install VSCode](/pages/vscode/initial-setup)
6. [Set up Jekyll](/pages/github/pages/jekyll/set-up-jekyll)

Once you follow through the steps above you should have a shiny new web page on a custom domain waiting for you to add content.
